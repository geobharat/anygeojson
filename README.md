# anygeojson
Python utility to generate geometries in any CRS

## Use Case
This would be helpful in creating Geometries for development purposes. Often times we need to check the code with geometries where we use tools such as [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/), but the problem is, it only supports EPSG:4326, we propose python (and also JS utility) to help user create geometries
